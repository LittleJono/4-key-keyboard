NOTE: I have not ordered this version of the PCB, I am not sure if it will work correctly.

EasyEDA or DirtyPCB will probably be the cheapest places to get the PCBs printed. I used DirtyPCB to get the first version of the PCBs printed and they turned out great.

The 'top.dxf' and 'bot.dxf' files are for the acrylic case. I got them cut from DirtyPCB, they were really cheap and the case turned out nice.

I used RobotDyn's Digispark clone: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Digispark-compatible-developing-board-ATtiny85-MicroUSB/32733676895.html
Other digispark clones will probably work with the footprint, you might have to bend the header pins to make them fit.

The case + PCB should work with 10mm M3 standoffs and 6mm M3 screws. The PCB does not screw into the case, it is held in place by the switches.

The PCB does not have holes for PCB mounted switches. You can probably just cut the extra pins off if you need to.

Assembly instructions

1. Solder the header pins. 
2. Place switches into the top place and solder the PCB onto the switches.
3. Solder the digispark to the header pins. You might want to put electrical tape ontop of the digispark to prevent it from shorting with the switch soldering.
